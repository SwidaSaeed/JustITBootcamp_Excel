# 🔎 Data Analysis Approach

## Data Structuring
- Organised raw data into structured Excel tables  
- Applied sorting and filtering  
- Ensured consistent formatting  

## Aggregation & Functions
- Calculated totals using `SUM()`  
- Calculated averages using `AVERAGE()`  
- Identified highest values using `MAX()`  

## Product Categorisation
Used the `SWITCH()` function to categorise products by sales volume:

- Sales > 600 → High  
- Sales 300–600 → Medium  
- Sales < 300 → Low

# 📊 Pivot Table Analysis

The pivot table summarises total sales percentages by:

- Gender  
- Product Category (Beauty, Clothing, Electronics)  

Conditional formatting was applied to highlight higher and lower performance segments.
